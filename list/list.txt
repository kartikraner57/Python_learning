list




If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity where insertion order preserved and duplicates are allowed, then we should go for List.

 ֍ insertion order preserved. 
 
 ֍ duplicate objects are allowed. ֍ heterogeneous objects are allowed. 
 
 ֍ List is dynamic because based on our requirement we can increase the size and decrease the size. 
 
 ֍ In List the elements will be placed within square brackets and with comma seperator.
 
 ֍ We can differentiate duplicate elements by using index and we can preserve insertion order by using index. Hence index will play very important role. 
 
 ֍ Python supports both positive and negative indexes. +ve index means from left to right where as negative index means right to left. [10,"A","B",20, 30, 10]


10 A B 20 30 10

֍ List objects are mutable.i.e we can change the content


#####Creation of List Objects:
#1) We can create empty list object as follows... 
1) list=[] 
2) print(list) 
3) print(type(list)) 
4) 
5) [] 
6) <class 'list'> 
#2) If we know elements already then we can create list as follows list = [10, 20, 30, 40]

#3) With Dynamic Input: 
1) list=eval(input("Enter List:")) 
2) print(list) 
3) print(type(list)

#4) With list() Function: 
1) l=list(range(0,10,2)) 
2) print(l) 
3) print(type(l))


#5) With split() Function: 
1) s="Learning Python is very very easy !!!" 
2) l=s.split() 
3) print(l) 
4) print(type(l))
