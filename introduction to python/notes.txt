language fundamentals :

#introduction 


 #test.py =file of python
  #"guido van Rosson" this  person  introduce python(1989) NRI Netherland .
  IN feb 20th 1991 introduce to  public.

python = programing language
       = high level language
       = general purpose language
       = simple and easy to understand 
       = very less code / concise code
       = use in AI, ml, DL, NN ,ds and IOT
python simple program =

print("hellow world")
a = 10
b = 20
print("the sum,a+b)
Q) why code/name python salected ?
=> The complete  "monty python's circus" BBc 1969 to 1974


#features of python 
              =    functional programing features from c,functional programing language.
              = object oriented programing language.
              = scripting language , means one by one  code exicute
              = modular programing  language
              = python is all rounder

#where we can use python :
= dekstop applications
= web applications
= network applications
= games development
= data analysis
= ML, DL, NN, AI, IOT.

# spacific features of python 
1) simple and easy to lern
= 33 resurve words for python
= python code is something like a reading english statements.
2)concise code 
= cost of the project development will be redudced,like length of the code will be less
3)freeware and  open source
= it is the free where sny person can use even for business sake
= pyhon software foundation (PSF) is respodisble for this to  maintain to python. download from"python.org".
= we aew not required to pay single paisa beacsuse python is comming from python software foundation it is non profit organazation
= it is the opensource so we can access code of the python based on your requiremnt.can customize python 
4)high level programing language

=high-level languages are easier to use and
 faster to write compared to low-level languages, which are closer to how computers actually process instructions.
=we are not required to worry low level activities like memory management,security

5)platform independent
= write python applications once run any platform like windows, linux, mAc.
= write once run anywhere is the concept of platform independent.
= python virtual machine (pvm)for windows,linux,mAc.
= python program is platform independent and python virtual machine is platform dependant.
6)portability
without performing any  changees in our application or with minimum changes,you can migrate our python
6)dynamically typed
= means variable types are determined at runtime, and you don't need to declare them explicitly.
 The type can change during execution.
= x = 10      # integer    ,x = "Hello" # now a string
=in python weare not required to declare type explicitly based on provided value.Automatically typed will be considered.
7)both procedure oriented & object oriented
=pyhton is procedure oriented, oop,scripting language , modular
all rounder.
8)independent
=we can not required to compile internaly ,python interpretor is going to takr-e care about comliation syntax cheakin all those things.
it is the part of python vrtual machine   
8)extensiable
=we can use other language application in our python code.
10)embedded
= IN our python application to you can use other code
11)extensiable library



limitations of  python =>
1)mobile applications = pyhon is not suitable to develop mobile application
2)entrprice application = banking application , telecom application
3)performance is low =interpreted programming languages are lack of performance.
4)



Flavors of python :
1)C python c- language application
2)jpython/jython= java application
3)ruby pyhon : rubyplatform
5) anaconda python= to work with large valume
6)stackless(pythn for concurency)
7)pypy(python for speed)



python versions
python 0.9.0. => feb 20th 1991
python 1.0    => jan 1994
Python 2.0 October 16th, 2000.PY2K. = Python three point x developed has completely independent language.
 Python 3.0 came December 3rd, 2008 PY3K.

 Python three point x developed has completely independent language.
 Assume that python three x is not a extension to python two x.

It is a developed a completely independent language.

Remember this one 

Python three point x developed has completely independent language.





This language sir not extension to python two point x version.

Remember that That's why if it is the next new release, it should provide support for old versions.

But it is a developed, like complete brand new programming language.

That's why Python three point X version won't provide support for Python two point 



ython three x There is no guarantee it is going to provide support for python two point x regardingt 
Python 3.7.2.
So this is the which version we require to install.

The latest version as of today is python.

Python 3.7.2. 
install from python.org
We can run python code by using python ide lg.

What is this ideal python? = integrated development and learning environment 
it is REPL tool ,= r=>read
                   e=>evolve
                   p=>print
                   l=>loop






python identifiers = A name in Python program is called identifier, 
which can be used for identification purpose.
It can be a method name variable name class name which can be used for identification purpose.

rules for python identifiers = 1) a -z, A -Z, 0 to 10(These are the only characters which are allowed
in python identifiers by mistake. If you are using any other symbol syntax error.)
                               2) total 123 = 10(this is right )
                                  1233total = 10(this is wrong ) That identifier should not starts with a digit by mistake identifier starts with the digit immediately.Syntax error
                               3) total = 10
                                  Total = 20 
                                  TOTAL = 30 Python is case sensitive programming language where case is important.
                                 Of course, python identifiers are also case sensitive regarding so lowercase and uppercase.
                               4) no lenght limit(but not recommended to take too lengthy identifiers.)
                               5)x= 10(right)
                                 if = 20(rong)

Q.)which of the following are valid pthon identifiers ?
=>
1)cash (right)
2)ca$has3 (wrong)
3)total123 (right)
4)1233total (wrong)
5)all@hands (wrong)
6)java2share(right)
7)if (wrong)
8)-durga__python(right) 

x => simple
_x => protected
__x =>private
__x__ =>magic veriable

18. python reservd words


Reserved words are only regarding how many reserved words 33 reserved words.
