########3 for loop for sequence ==1) for loop: If we want to execute some action for every element present in some sequence (it may be string or collection) then we should go for for loop.
#  Syntax: for x in sequence: 
# Body (Where sequence can be string or any collection. Body will be executed for every element present in the sequence.)
# s = "kanha raner"
# for x in s :
#     print(x)
# for x in range(20):
#     print(x)

# k = "kanha raner"
# i = 0
# for x in k :
#     i = i+1
#     print("the charecter present a : {} index :{}".format(i,x))

########## for loop for sequence
# for x  in range (10) :
#     print("welcom to python for loop")

# for x in range(1,11) :
#     print(x)
 
########## to disply 0dd number from o to 20

# for x in range(30):
#     print(x)
#     if x % 2:
#         print(x)


# for x in range(1,20,2):
