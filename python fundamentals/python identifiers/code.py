python identifiers = A name in Python program is called identifier, 
which can be used for identification purpose.
It can be a method name variable name class name which can be used for identification purpose.

rules for python identifiers = 1) a -z, A -Z, 0 to 10(These are the only characters which are allowed
in python identifiers by mistake. If you are using any other symbol syntax error.)
                               2) total 123 = 10(this is right )
                                  1233total = 10(this is wrong ) That identifier should not starts with a digit by mistake identifier starts with the digit immediately.Syntax error
                               3) total = 10
                                  Total = 20 
                                  TOTAL = 30 Python is case sensitive programming language where case is important.
                                 Of course, python identifiers are also case sensitive regarding so lowercase and uppercase.
                               4) no lenght limit(but not recommended to take too lengthy identifiers.)
                               5)x= 10(right)
                                 if = 20(rong)
