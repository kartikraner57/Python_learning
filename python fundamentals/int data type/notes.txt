1) int :
          int is a built-in Python data type that stores whole numbers,
          both positive and negative, without any fractional or
          decimal component. It supports mathematical operations and
          can represent numbers of virtually any size, constrained only by available memory.

So integral values I want to represent in number without a decimal point.

Do you know just to ten I want to represent or 1 to 20 I want to represent.

1)decimal form(base-10)
2)binary form(base-2)
3)octal form(base-8)
4)hexa decimal(base-16)
