 
 In Python, the complex data type is used to represent complex numbers.
 A complex number consists of two parts:

A real part (which is a float or integer)
An imaginary part (which is a float or integer, and is represented with a j or J after the number)

syntax = complex_number = real_part + imaginary_part * j (a + b j)
:The real part is a standard number (float or integer).
:The imaginary part is written with a j at the end (e.g., 3j, 5.6j).
