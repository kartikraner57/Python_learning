language fundamentals :

#introduction 


 #test.py =file of python
  #"guido van Rosson" this  person  introduce python(1989) NRI Netherland .
  IN feb 20th 1991 introduce to  public.

python = programing language
       = high level language
       = general purpose language
       = simple and easy to understand 
       = very less code / concise code
       = use in AI, ml, DL, NN ,ds and IOT
python simple program =

print("hellow world")
a = 10
b = 20
print("the sum,a+b)
Q) why code/name python salected ?
=> The complete  "monty python's circus" BBc 1969 to 1974


#features of python 
              =    functional programing features from c,functional programing language.
              = object oriented programing language.
              = scripting language , means one by one  code exicute
              = modular programing  language
              = python is all rounder

#where we can use python :
= dekstop applications
= web applications
= network applications
= games development
= data analysis
= ML, DL, NN, AI, IOT.

# spacific features of python 
1) simple and easy to lern
= 33 resurve words for python
= python code is something like a reading english statements.
2)concise code 
= cost of the project development will be redudced,like length of the code will be less
3)freeware and  open source
= it is the free where sny person can use even for business sake
= pyhon software foundation (PSF) is respodisble for this to  maintain to python. download from"python.org".
4)high level programing language
=high-level languages are easier to use and
 faster to write compared to low-level languages, which are closer to how computers actually process instructions.
=we are not required to worry low level activities like memory management,security
5)platform independent
= write python applications once run any platform like windows, linux, mAc.
= write once run anywhere is the concept of platform independent.
= python virtual machine (pvm)for windows,linux,mAc.
= python program is platform independent and python virtual machine is platform dependant.
6)portability
without performing any  changees in our application or with minimum changes,you can migrate our python
