language fundamentals :

#introduction 


 #test.py =file of python
  #"guido van Rosson" this  person  introduce python(1989) NRI Netherland .
  IN feb 20th 1991 introduce to  public.

python = programing language
       = high level language
       = general purpose language
       = simple and easy to understand 
       = very less code / concise code
       = use in AI, ml, DL, NN ,ds and IOT
python simple program =

print("hellow world")
a = 10
b = 20
print("the sum,a+b)
Q) why code/name python salected ?
=> The complete  "monty python's circus" BBc 1969 to 1974


#features of python 
              =    functional programing features from c,functional programing language.
              = object oriented programing language.
              = scripting language , means one by one  code exicute
              = modular programing  language
              = python is all rounder

#where we can use python :
= dekstop applications
= web applications
= network applications
= games development
= data analysis
= ML, DL, NN, AI, IOT.

# spacific features of python 
1) simple and easy to lern
= 33 resurve words for python
= python code is something like a reading english statements.
2)concise code 
= cost of the project development will be redudced,like length of the code will be less
3)freeware and  open source
= it is the free where sny person can use even for business sake
= pyhon software foundation (PSF) is respodisble for this to  maintain to python. download from"python.org".
= we aew not required to pay single paisa beacsuse python is comming from python software foundation it is non profit organazation
= it is the opensource so we can access code of the python based on your requiremnt.can customize python 
4)high level programing language

=high-level languages are easier to use and
 faster to write compared to low-level languages, which are closer to how computers actually process instructions.
=we are not required to worry low level activities like memory management,security

5)platform independent
= write python applications once run any platform like windows, linux, mAc.
= write once run anywhere is the concept of platform independent.
= python virtual machine (pvm)for windows,linux,mAc.
= python program is platform independent and python virtual machine is platform dependant.
6)portability
without performing any  changees in our application or with minimum changes,you can migrate our python
6)dynamically typed
= means variable types are determined at runtime, and you don't need to declare them explicitly.
 The type can change during execution.
= x = 10      # integer    ,x = "Hello" # now a string
=in python weare not required to declare type explicitly based on provided value.Automatically typed will be considered.
7)both procedure oriented & object oriented
=pyhton is procedure oriented, oop,scripting language , modular
all rounder.
8)independent
=we can not required to compile internaly ,python interpretor is going to takr-e care about comliation syntax cheakin all those things.
it is the part of python vrtual machine   
8)extensiable
=we can use other language application in our python code.
10)embedded
= IN our python application to you can use other code
11)extensiable library



limitations of  python =>
1)mobile applications = pyhon is not suitable to develop mobile application
2)entrprice application = banking application , telecom application
3)performance is low =interpreted programming languages are lack of performance.
4)



Flavors of python :
1)C python c- language application
2)jpython/jython= java application
3)ruby pyhon : rubyplatform
5) anaconda python
